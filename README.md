# F1 Season Tracker

This year I have really gotten into F1 racing because of the Netflix show [Drive to Survive](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890) (I couldn't recommend it more highly).

As a result, I have started to follow F1 more closely but have kept running into the problem of not having a great place to visualize standings over the course of a given F1 season. It's easy to find out who won the championship or who is leading the current season but the beauty of F1 is the journey of a year. 

I recently came across a tool called [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that makes it really easy to deploy data applications in python and boy is it fun to work with.

Basically this streamlit application allows the user to input a given round, season, and championship and plot the course of the season.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
```
